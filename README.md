# reast-Cancer-Prediction-using-Quantum-Machine-Learning-QSVM-
This project applies Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) to classify breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant. By leveraging quantum kernels in Qiskit, we explore the potential of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) to solve real-world biomedical classification problems.
